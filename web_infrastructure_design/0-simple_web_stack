Step 1: Understand the requirements
The statement specifies that we must use the following components:

1 server
1 web server (Nginx)
1 application server
1 set of application files (code base)
1 database (MySQL)
Configure the domain name foobar.com with a www record that points to the server's IP address 8.8.8.8.


Step 2: Understand the key concepts
Before designing the infrastructure, we need to understand some key concepts mentioned in the statement:

A server is a physical or virtual machine that provides computational resources and services over a network.
The domain name is the human-readable address used to access a website. In this case, foobar.com is the domain name.
The DNS (Domain Name System) record is used to associate a domain name with an IP address. The www record is a subdomain that points to a specific IP address.
The web server is responsible for receiving HTTP requests from clients and sending them the corresponding responses. In this case, we will use Nginx as the web server.
The application server runs the application code and dynamically generates web pages. It works in conjunction with the web server to process requests and deliver appropriate responses.
The database stores and retrieves the information necessary for the application to function properly. We will use MySQL as the database in this infrastructure.

Step 3: Design the infrastructure
With the components and key concepts in mind, we can design the web infrastructure:

Step 1: The user wants to access the website www.foobar.com.
Step 2: The user types "www.foobar.com" in the browser and hits Enter.
Step 3: The browser sends an HTTP request to the IP address associated with www.foobar.com.
Step 4: The DNS server resolves the correct IP address based on the www record in the foobar.com domain name. In this case, the DNS server returns the IP address 8.8.8.8.
Step 5: The HTTP request reaches the server with the IP address 8.8.8.8.
Step 6: The Nginx web server receives the request and processes it. Nginx is responsible for handling multiple simultaneous requests and delivering the corresponding responses.
Step 7: If the request requires application processing, the application server (e.g., a Java application server like Tomcat) receives the request from Nginx.
Step 8: The application server executes the application code and generates a dynamic response based on the request.
Step 9: If the application needs to access stored data, a query is made to the MySQL database.
Step 10: The MySQL database retrieves the requested data and sends it back to the application server.
Step 11: The application server receives the data from the database and generates a complete response.
Step 12: The final response is sent from the application server to the Nginx web server.
Step 13: The Nginx web server sends the response to the user's browser.
Step 14: The user's browser receives the response and displays the www.foobar.com website.


Step 4: Identify the issues with this infrastructure
The designed infrastructure has some issues:

SPOF (Single Point of Failure): If the single server fails, the website will become inaccessible.
Downtime during maintenance: If maintenance is required on the web server, the website will be offline during that period.
Inability to scale with high incoming traffic: If the website receives a large amount of traffic, a single server may not be enough to handle the load and may result in poor performance or site downtime.
